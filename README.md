Skill for Auctions car sales.  

Alice Facts is a convenient way to get car sales, car titles reports for Auctions executives. 

To start, just say "Alexa, Alice facts", "Alexa, open Alice facts", "cars sold yesterday", "cars sold last week", "how many cars sold last year" "titles last week". 

At anytime, you can stop by saying "Alexa, cancel"
